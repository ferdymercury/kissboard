# Kisscase
A 3D printable case for the kissboard made with freecad. Currently two variants are planned: simple and "complex". The simple variant is currently work in progress. The complex one just a concept.

# Simple Variant
The simple variant is meant to work with the V1.0 of the kissboard without any holes for mounting and uses a very simple "clamp" to fix the board in a base.
